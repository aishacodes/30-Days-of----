## Cloud service models

- IAAS used by system admins : basic building blocks for cloud information technology, provides networking features, storage sspace. e.g AWS, Azure
- PAAS used by developers: removes need to manage underlying infrastructure, through automation. It allows you to focus on deployment and management. e.g heroku, Google App Engine
- SAAS everyone, end users: provides you with complete product. e.g Gmail, microsoft office

## Cloud computing deployment model

- Public Cloud: Fully deployed in the cloud.Fully utilizing cloud computing. All part of application runs in the cloud. Example: Using Google Drive or deploying an app on Vercel.
- Hybrid: Deployment is in such a way that to connect existing infrastructure and applications to cloud-basedd resources. E.g cloud and existing on-premises resources. Example: A hospital using a private cloud for patient data and public cloud for running its website.
- On premisis ( private cloud): Uses virtualization and resource management tools. Everything built on the company's data center. Example: A bank running its own cloud server.
