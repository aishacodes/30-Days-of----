# Fundamentals of Pricing

Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS

- Compute
  - Charged per hour/second
  - Varies by instance type Linux only
- Storage
  - Charged typically per GB
- Data transfer
  - Outbound is aggregated and charged•
  - Inbound has no charge (with some exceptions)
  - Charged typically per GB

## Invest in Reserved Instances (RIs):

- All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI) → largest discount
- Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI) → lower discounts
- No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance (NURI) → smaller discount

### Services with no charge

- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you
  define.
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls your users’ access to AWS services and
  resources.
- Consolidated Billing is a billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate payment for
  multiple AWS accounts or multiple Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL)
  accounts\*. Consolidated billing provides:
  • One bill for multiple accounts.
  • The ability to easily track each account’s charges.
  • The opportunity to decrease charges as a result of volume pricing discounts from
  combined usage.
  • And you can consolidate all of your accounts using Consolidated Billing and get tiered
  benefits.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an even easier way for you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud.
- AWS CloudFormation gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.
- Automatic Scaling automatically adds or removes resources according to conditions you define. The resources you are using increase seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.
- AWS OpsWorks is an application management service that makes it easy to deploy and operate applications of all shapes and sizes.
